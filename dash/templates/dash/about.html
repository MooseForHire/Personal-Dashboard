    <h1>  <strong> About Guyaki </strong> </h1>
    <p> I created Guyaki as a personal project of mine to show off my skills as an aspiring developer. What you are about to see is the product of
        me learning Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Python, MySQL, Django,  and many more things. This basic dashboard is meant to be a usable space for you to track
        daily tasks and increase productivity.
