<h2> What is it?
  </h2>
  
<p>This project is a functional To-Do list application utilizing class components.</p>

<h2>What does it show?
  </h2>
  
<p> This project demonstrates my ability to use class components to properly store and set state, use the Web Storage API to store the data in localStorage, and use callback functions passed as props to do so.
  </p>
  
<h2>Will you accept pull requests?
  </h2>
  
<p>Not at this time, as with the other projects on this profile they are to demonstrate proficiency over their respective components. However, feedback on how to improve/expand projects will always be welcome.
